## Why PCs Matter in Esports

Gaming PCs are the foundation of most esports programs. They provide the performance and flexibility needed to play a wide range of competitive titles, from first-person shooters to strategy games. High-quality PCs ensure that players can focus on their skills without being hindered by hardware limitations.

## Key Components of a Gaming PC

When selecting PCs for your esports program, focus on the following components:

### **CPU (Processor)**
The CPU is the brain of the computer and plays a significant role in gaming performance. Look for processors with high clock speeds and multiple cores. Popular options include:
- **Intel Core i5/i7** or **AMD Ryzen 5/7** for mid-range setups.
- **Intel Core i9** or **AMD Ryzen 9** for high-performance setups.

### **GPU (Graphics Card)**
A powerful GPU is essential for rendering high-quality graphics and maintaining high frame rates. Recommended GPUs include:
- **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060/4060** for budget-friendly options.
- **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070/4070** for competitive-level gaming.
- **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080/4090** for top-tier performance.

For schools on a budget, consider slightly older models like the GTX 1660 Ti.

### **RAM**
Memory is critical for smooth gameplay. Ensure that each PC has at least:
- **16GB of RAM** for standard gaming.
- **32GB of RAM** for more demanding applications like streaming or content creation alongside gaming.

### **Storage**
Fast and reliable storage reduces load times and improves overall performance. Aim for:
- A **500GB to 1TB SSD** for quick game loading and responsiveness.
- An additional **HDD** for storing less frequently accessed files if needed.

### **Monitor**
Monitors should provide fast refresh rates and low response times. Key features to look for:
- **Refresh Rate**: 144Hz or higher for smooth visuals.
- **Resolution**: 1080p for most games; 1440p for higher-end setups.
- **Screen Size**: 24-27 inches is the sweet spot for competitive gaming.

### **Other Essentials**
- **Cooling Systems**: Proper cooling prevents overheating during long gaming sessions.
- **Power Supply Unit (PSU)**: Ensure the PSU can handle the demands of the CPU and GPU.
- **Case**: A well-ventilated case keeps components cool and allows for upgrades.

## Pre-Built vs. Custom-Built PCs

### **Pre-Built PCs**
- **Pros**: Easier to set up, includes warranties, and doesn’t require technical knowledge.
- **Cons**: Higher cost and limited customization.

### **Custom-Built PCs**
- **Pros**: Tailored to your program’s needs and often more cost-effective.
- **Cons**: Requires technical expertise to build and troubleshoot.

### Recommendation
For most schools, pre-built PCs are the most practical option due to ease of setup and support. However, if your program has access to technical expertise, custom-built PCs can be a cost-effective and flexible solution.
