# The LF Process

The Loyalty Foundation has developed a proven, systematic approach to implementing successful esports programs across schools, community centers, and youth-serving organizations. Our process focuses on sustainable program development through supportive coach selection, straightforward training, community engagement, and structured implementation.

## Overview of Implementation Steps

Our process follows these key stages:

1. **Coach Identification**: We work with your organization to identify potential coaches - no gaming expertise required! The best coaches are often those who connect well with youth and are willing to learn alongside them.

3. **Community Demo Day**: We help organize and run an engaging demo day to introduce esports to families and potential participants.
4. **Program Launch**: We assist with tryouts and league integration to get your program running smoothly.
