# Coach Selection & Criteria

Finding the right person to lead your esports program is a crucial first step - but don't worry! The most successful coaches often aren't gaming experts at all. Instead, they're individuals who enjoy working with young people and are excited to learn alongside them.

## What Makes a Great Esports Coach?

The best esports coaches share these qualities:

- **Enthusiasm for Youth Development**: A passion for helping young people grow and learn
- **Willingness to Learn**: Open mindset and ready to explore esports alongside participants
- **Basic Computer Comfort**: Familiar with using computers (but advanced tech skills aren't required)
- **Organization Skills**: Able to keep track of schedules and coordinate team activities
- **Communication Ability**: Can effectively communicate with youth, families, and organization leadership

## Common Coaching Candidates

We've seen successful coaches come from many different backgrounds:

- Teachers (any subject area!)
- Program coordinators
- Youth development staff
- Technology staff
- Volunteers
- After-school activity leaders
- Library staff
- Community center personnel

## Time Commitment

Coaches should be able to commit to:
- Attending our 4-hour training session
- Running 2-3 practices per week (typically 1-2 hours each)
- Supervising matches (usually once per week during season)
- Basic communication with families and program leadership

## Common Concerns

Many potential coaches worry about:

### "I don't know anything about video games!"
That's completely fine! Many of our most successful coaches started as gaming beginners. You'll learn the basics in our training, and students often enjoy helping coaches learn and improve.

### "I'm not sure I can commit enough time."
Our program is designed to be manageable. Most coaches find they can effectively run the program with 4-6 hours per week during the season.

### "What if I make mistakes?"
Everyone makes mistakes when learning something new. We provide ongoing support, and the students are usually very understanding and helpful.

### "I don't know how to teach esports!"
We provide structured practice plans and guidance. Plus, esports coaching is more about facilitating teamwork and positive behavior than teaching advanced game mechanics.
